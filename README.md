# Colony Wars Red Sun Ripper

### This respository hosts several programs to extract resources and convert models from **Colony Wars Red Sun**.

* **game_rsc_extract**: extracts resources from **GAME.RSC** file such as models, textures, mission scripts and more.
* **model_converter**: takes extracted models and TIM textures to convert them into [Wavefront .obj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file) format.
* **save_state_model_extract**: now obsolete program that directly extracted player ships in ship selection menu from ePSXe save states.
